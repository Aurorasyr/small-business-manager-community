2. XX/XX/2025 -- Proposed dev changes (pending merge).
   - Switched to absolute imports for long-term maintainability.
     - Added `__init__.py` file to folders that have modules.
   - Changed `app.py` to `sbm.py` to avoid ambiguity with folder naming.
   - SBM needs to run as a module now instead of a script.
     - `python -m app.sbm` command must be run from the working directory of `small-business-manager-community` or the folder that contains the `app` folder instead of `python app.py`.
     - üõ†Ô∏è Note: This may require the user to update how they launch the app.
